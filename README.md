Research-Sparklines
===================

Playing around with the idea of adding sparklines to dataset previews.

# The Idea

I want to be able to see quick previews for metadata about each dataset in a collection. Beyond that, it would be nice to sort based on these atributes.

# Stages

## 0.1
~~1. Collect metadata from two smaller datasets in the collection~~
~~2. Organize simple table view~~

## 0.2
~~1. Draw simple bubbles and sparklines~~

## 0.3
1. Pull data from json to generate the charts.

## Future
* Sort by underlying value (use tristen/tablesort on GitHub)
* Change / add which items are being sampled in the preview columns
* Beautify the layout
* Make this more reusable
* Pre-load data for speed
* Use .filter throughout each chart to limit calling the data over and over
* Dynamically create rows from d3 - has to be an array of arrays. 

# Open Questions? 
## Would this make more sense as a graph database? 
Because the structure of the datasets is not uniform it could useful to just describe each one in terms of the connections versus rigid, universal commonalities.

It's going to take some time to understand how to get a simple example of the ground in neo4j. Sticking with simple dummy data for now.
